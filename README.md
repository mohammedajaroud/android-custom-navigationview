Android custom NavigationView
===============================================================

Some times ago I was looking for how to customize the [NavigationView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/design/widget/NavigationView.html). Here I would like to share with my simple solution.

The ActionLayout in [Menu Resource](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/menu-resource.html) looks OK, but I needed something more flexible.
